Blockchain - Is it safe to eat?

Was created to solve the distributed computing war

Smart ethereum contracts

People are excited about blockchain --- Why?
    - Bitcoin
    - Cryptocurrencies

What is a blockchain?
    - Basic data structure
    - Blockchain is built on merkle trees
    - merkle trees use a one-way hash
        - gives us a unique number. However you cannot translate said number back
        - MD5
        - sha-1
        - sha-2
            - hashes
            - checksum
            - ssl certs
    - You can hash two hashes to get a unique value
    - This makes it very quick to see if there are differences
    - This also works with the order of the data. If hashes are incorrect the chain breaks
    - you can verify petabytes of data by simply comparing a 64 byte number
    - you can also find fault very quickly
        - petabyte in 9 operations

Extreme Computation
    - Merkle trees aren't good enough
    - Good for data syncing
    - We need proof
        - computationally expensive enough to cost electricity
        - hashes always match the same set of bytes
        - a single character will throw the hash off completely
            - called salting the hash
    - you can change hash values by appending data
